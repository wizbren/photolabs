# PhotoLabs React Application

A responsive single-page photo gallery built with React. Users can browse and favourite photos,
filter them by topic, and select photos to view in a larger format, and then select others
from a list of similar-topic photos. Designed to be simple and sleek, I hope you enjoy.
